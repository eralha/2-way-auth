<h1>2 Factor authentication</h1>

<p>Impementing Time-Based One-Time Password, authentication based on a random generated serial number, as described here: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6238</p>

<p>2 factor auth is based on 2 components, 1ยบ is what user knows like a password, 2ยบ is something that user have, like a cellphone. This is just an example implementation, for example this could be a phonegap app that generates serial codes and stores them as a passcode. The user can then associate that serial to the user account, each time the user wants to access is account he/she need's to check the app and provide the OTP + password.
